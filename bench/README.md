# Benchmark
I used this crate to benchmark multiple implementations of my game of life.
It uses the “pulsar” pattern of the game of life and update it 1000 times.

## First version
The first benchmark was made from the commit 1341e2524898a20f46939e128e6490377d7a5fa6 :
```
test tests::bench ... bench:   6,517,132 ns/iter (+/- 145,113)
```
